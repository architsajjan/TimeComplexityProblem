# Time Complexity Problem (java soln)
```
One may find multiple solutions to any problem,
this is, as of now the best known solution to me.
```

### Problem Statement
---
>You have a sorted array=[1,2,3,4,5] and if you rotate it by 2, then the array becomes: [4,5,1,2,3]
you have to take two inputs, one the amount to rotate the array clockwise, second an item to find in rotated array, **if item found print its index, else print -1**
                             *DO THIS IN O(N) TIME*
